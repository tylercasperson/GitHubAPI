# Github Finder

### Here is the link to the live website: [Github Finder](https://finder-github-finder.netlify.app/)

This was built from a [Brad Traversy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/).

Search for github users. When you press the more button info about the user is displayed. You will see the last 5 repos created, is the person hireable, personal website, and more github account informaion. Uses the github API.

Another application that I designed started to have a lot of code that could have been written better. So I looked for a better way and found a tutorial to help me code cleaner.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
